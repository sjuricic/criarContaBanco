BPM Suite sample project.

This project contains a process definition which shows how to use some jbpm assets such as task nodes, gateways and subprocesses based on bpmn2 specification.

In order to test it, you will need to create a "brmsuser" user with "admin" role. Then, clone it to business-central, build&deploy the project.
